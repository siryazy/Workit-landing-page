## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS3 (custom properties, Flexbox, Grid, clip-path)
* Mobile-first workflow
* Google Fonts: **Fraunces** & **Manrope**

### What I learned

* Creating a curved header bottom using `clip-path` to match the design.
* Implementing a fully mobile-first responsive layout with media queries at **768px** and **1024px**.
* Using CSS Grid to switch between 1‑, 2‑, and 3‑column feature sections.
* Managing z‑index and positioning for overlapping elements (hero image, patterns).

### Continued development

* Enhance accessibility: add keyboard focus states, ARIA labels, and better contrast testing.
* Explore fluid typography with the `clamp()` function for smoother scale across breakpoints.
* Add subtle animations or transitions (e.g., CSS keyframes or GSAP) to bring the page to life.

### Useful resources

* [CSS clip-path guide](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) – Interactive tool for generating clip-path shapes.
* [MDN Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) – Reference for writing responsive breakpoints.
